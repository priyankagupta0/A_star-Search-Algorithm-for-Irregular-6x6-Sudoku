# A_star-Search-Algorithm-for-Jigsaw-6x6-Sudoku
This project implements the A* search algorithm for solving irregular 6x6 Sudoku puzzles. Irregular Sudoku, also known as Jigsaw Sudoku, introduces a new level of complexity by dividing the puzzle into irregularly shaped regions, making it a fascinating challenge for puzzle solvers.

We're using the A* search algorithm with the SimpleAI module, based on the "Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach" book. I aimed to treat the irregular sudoku puzzle as a search problem and create heuristics to avoid revisiting the same states in the algorithm.

### About Irregular Sudoku:

Irregular Sudoku, or Jigsaw Sudoku, presents an engaging challenge by dividing the 6x6 grid into irregularly shaped regions, making it an interesting twist on the classic puzzle.
An irregular 6x6 sudoku has the following form:

### A* Search Algorithm:

A* is a widely used pathfinding algorithm that can efficiently find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal. In this project, the A* algorithm is adapted to find the solution to irregular 6x6 Sudoku puzzles.

### Project Goals:

The primary goal of this project is to provide a solver for irregular 6x6 Sudoku puzzles using the A* search algorithm. The algorithm will find a solution to the puzzle and demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of A* in this context.
