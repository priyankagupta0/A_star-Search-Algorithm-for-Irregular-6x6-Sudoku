# A_star-Search-Algorithm-for-Irregular-6x6-Sudoku
This project is an implementation of the A* search algorithm for solving irregular 6x6 Sudoku puzzles. Irregular Sudoku, also known as Jigsaw Sudoku, introduces a new level of complexity by dividing the puzzle into irregularly shaped regions, making it a fascinating challenge for puzzle solvers.

### About Irregular Sudoku:

Irregular Sudoku, or Jigsaw Sudoku, presents an engaging challenge by dividing the 6x6 grid into irregularly shaped regions, making it an interesting twist on the classic puzzle.

### A* Search Algorithm:

A* is a widely used pathfinding algorithm that can efficiently find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal. In this project, the A* algorithm is adapted to find the solution to irregular 6x6 Sudoku puzzles.

### Project Goals:

The primary goal of this project is to provide a solver for irregular 6x6 Sudoku puzzles using the A* search algorithm. The algorithm will find a solution to the puzzle and demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of A* in this context.
