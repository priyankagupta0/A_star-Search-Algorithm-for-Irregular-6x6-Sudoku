# A_star-Search-Algorithm-for-Irregular-6x6-Sudoku
This project is an implementation of the A* search algorithm for solving irregular 6x6 Sudoku puzzles. Irregular Sudoku, also known as Jigsaw Sudoku, introduces a new level of complexity by dividing the puzzle into irregularly shaped regions, making it a fascinating challenge for puzzle solvers.
