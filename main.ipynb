    "# A* :\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* (pronounced \"A-star\") search algorithm is a widely used and effective pathfinding algorithm. It's commonly used in various fields, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and video games. A* is an extension of dijkstra algorithm and is used to find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal in a graph, grid, or map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a high-level explanation of the A* search algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - You start with a graph or grid representing your environment. Each location in this environment is called a \"node\" or \"cell.\"\n",
    "   - You have a starting node and a goal node. The goal is the destination you want to reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Open List and Closed List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A* uses two lists: the \"Open List\" and the \"Closed List.\"\n",
    "   - The Open List holds nodes that need to be explored or considered.\n",
    "   - The Closed List holds nodes that have already been explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **G and H Scores:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Each node on the Open List has two values associated with it: G and H scores.\n",
    "   - G (the \"cost-so-far\") represents the actual cost to reach a particular node from the starting node.\n",
    "   - H (the \"heuristic\") is an estimate of the cost from the current node to the goal. It's a heuristic because it doesn't give you the exact cost but an estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **F Score:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The F score is the sum of G and H: `F = G + H`.\n",
    "   - A* selects the node with the lowest F score from the Open List, as this is the node that is estimated to be the most promising.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Expanding Nodes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For the selected node, you expand it by considering its neighbors (often called \"successor\" nodes).\n",
    "   - Calculate G and H scores for each neighbor.\n",
    "   - If a neighbor is not on the Open or Closed List, add it to the Open List with the calculated F, G, and H scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Choosing the Next Node:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The node with the lowest F score on the Open List becomes the next node to explore.\n",
    "   - If the goal node is selected, the path is found, and you can reconstruct the path by tracing back from the goal node to the start node.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Repeat:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Continue this process until you reach the goal node, or the Open List becomes empty (indicating that there is no path to the goal).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Optimality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A* is known for its optimality; it guarantees that it will find the shortest path if one exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "A* uses a combination of the G and H scores to prioritize exploring nodes. The G score ensures that the algorithm explores paths with lower actual costs, and the H score guides it toward the goal. By considering the total cost (F score), A* efficiently finds the optimal path. However, it's important to choose an appropriate heuristic for the problem to ensure A* works effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
